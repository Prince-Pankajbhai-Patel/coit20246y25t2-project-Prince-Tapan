## Collaboration Approach
This effort depends on teamwork and collaborative communication. There should be clarity of roles and expectations to ensure a consistent workflow.

The following communication principles are availed to ensure alignment, productivity, and systematic progression during the project course.

### Communication Channels
Several platforms are chosen based on the situation and need:
- **Instant Messaging (Slack, Teams)**: Appropriate for brief clarifications, real-time inquiries, and short interactions during work hours.
- **Email**: This is mostly used in formal notices, file sharing, providing in-depth commentary or distributing official directives.
- **Video Meetings (Zoom, Google Meet)**: It is held during weekly team-wide meetings and when it is necessary to engage in an interactive session.
- **Project Tools (Trello, Jira)**: The tools were used to establish the deadlines, assign tasks, track tasks, and keep the project visible.


### Meeting Structure
Regular and properly organised meetings are essential to track progress and hold to accountability:

- **Weekly Team Sessions**:
  - **Schedule**: Every Monday, 8:00 AM
  - **Focus**: Check finished tasks, emphasise the challenges experienced, and plan the tasks of the next week.

- **Milestone Reviews**:
  - **Period**: End of Weeks 7, 9, and 10
  - **Goal**: Check the progress against objectives, assess the unmet objectives, and update strategies where necessary.

### Reporting Process

To promote responsibility and transparency in the group:

1. The individual members provide a brief written report using the common management system by Sunday evening.
2. Reports should include achievements, problems encountered, and activities to be undertaken in the next week.
3. These updates inform Monday meetings and help to solve issues together.

### Roles in Communication
Specifying roles will bring a more coordinated and clear process:
- **Coordinator (Project Lead)**:
  - Plans meetings, builds mutual understanding, and solves any communication breakdowns.
- **Team Members**:
  - Discuss, update on tasks, and create barriers to group problem-solving.


## Activity Schedule
